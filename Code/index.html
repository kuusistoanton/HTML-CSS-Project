                        <p>I am a software developer student with a wide range of interests varying from software and game development to stuff like cooking and calisthenics. I also have a strong passion of helping people like you reach your own goals with your programming projects. If you ever feel stuck and don't know what to do or just need a second pair of eyes. You can contact me and we can plan how I could help.</p>
